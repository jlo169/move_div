# move_div
Testing how to move a div around the page with using arrow keys. Perhaps can use this to go into another more fun personal projects.

Will use just basic html, css, and javascript to practice practical use of keydown. Adding jQuery since hasn't used it in a while to brush up. Also going to try to apply some click stuff.
